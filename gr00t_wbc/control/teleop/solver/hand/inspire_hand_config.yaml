# Inspire Hand Configuration
# Values are in range [0, 1] where 0=close, 1=open

# Finger closing limits (as percentage, e.g., 0.9 = 90% max close)
# The actual min_open value = 1.0 - max_close
finger_limits:
  # Thumb and index finger max closing percentage
  thumb_index_max_close: 0.9  # Can close 90%, min open = 0.1
  # Other fingers (pinky, ring, middle) max closing percentage  
  other_fingers_max_close: 0.7  # Can close 70%, min open = 0.3
  # Minimum open position (floor for all fingers)
  min_open_floor: 0.1

# Interpolation speeds (0.0-1.0)
# Lower = smoother/slower, Higher = faster/more responsive
interpolation:
  finger_speed: 0.7  # Speed for 4 fingers
  thumb_speed: 0.5   # Speed for thumb (more precise control)

# Thumb rotation settings
thumb_rotation:
  increment: 0.05  # Increment per update when button is held
